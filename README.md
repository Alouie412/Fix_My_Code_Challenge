This readme fixes stuff!

0-fizzbuzz.py: The error was that the if statement checks whether or not the value divides by 3 BEFORE checking divides by 3 and 5. As 15, and all multiples of 15, passes the divide by 3 check first, the if statement checking divides by 3 and divides by 5 will never run. Order matters, as code is always run line by line from the top to the bottom
